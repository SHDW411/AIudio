The project aims to create a Windows application to play music files with complex personalization functionalities managed through machine learning. The reason for its creation is the need for easy management and playback of sound files on PC with the feature of generating playlists according to a specific attribute like genre or mood of the listener. The application is capable of controlling file tags. In perspective, we expect to add a sound-visualization extension. The app will be written in Python with the use of external libraries.
